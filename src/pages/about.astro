		<p>I build systems — digital, emotional, spiritual, and physical.</p>

		<p>I'm a technical program manager, software architect, and developer with over a decade of experience building scalable products. I've founded companies, led teams, and shipped software used by millions. Now I split my time between building tools, raising my kids, and building a homestead in Puerto Rico.</p>

		<p>But that's just part of it.</p>

		<p>I'm also a father, artist, martial artist, mentor, and the founder of <strong>Strong Hands, Soft Heart</strong> — a brand devoted to practical strength, emotional depth, and sacred self-reliance.</p>

		<p>This blog is where I document it all:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Art & Expression</strong> 🎵 — creative soul, aesthetic power, truth-telling</li>
			<li><strong>DIY & Creation</strong> 🛠️ — physical builds, handmade goods, crafting</li>
			<li><strong>Integration & Growth</strong> 🧘🏽‍♂️ — inner mastery, parenting, masculine leadership</li>
			<li><strong>Learning Projects</strong> 📚 — documentation of mastery in progress</li>
			<li><strong>Metaspace</strong> 🌀 — reflections on the journey itself</li>
			<li><strong>Parenting</strong> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 — raising resilient children, family dynamics, and personal growth</li>
			<li><strong>Politics</strong> ⚖️ — power dynamics, social structures, and collective healing</li>
			<li><strong>Psychology</strong> 🧠 — human behavior, social dynamics, and mental processes</li>
			<li><strong>Systems & Strategy</strong> 💻 — technical systems, organizational design, and strategic thinking</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Join me on this journey of exploration, creation, and growth.</p>
