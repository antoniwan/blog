These books have given me the tools and techniques to be a conscious and powerful human being. A stoic who's life is entirely up to myself (or so I think, right?!). My days have intention and focus. My values are reflected in every single decision that I take throughout my day. Walking the talk, I call it.

My favorites have the ðŸ”¥ emoji - I feel these books helped me the most.
