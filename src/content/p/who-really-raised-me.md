I’ve been thinking a lot about who raised me to be who I am. And I’m preparing an essay about that. _But this one is not about that._ This one is about the **CARTOONS** and **TV** that raised me.

<small>My daughter and I. Talking about magic fruit. Wink.</small>

When I think about what I value today, throughout my life, from childhood to now, I can only admit that fictional characters have influenced me heavily in my upbringing, my emotions, my feelings, and my paradigms. It’s absolutely insane!!! Jajaja

I was able to identify many of the emotions tied to each. Here’s how it goes!

## Here’s my fictional character pantheon!!

🗡️ **Samurai X / Kenshin Himura** —  The repentant warrior. Strength in silence. Discipline forged through trauma.

🔥 **Los Caballeros del Zodiaco** —  Brotherhood. Sacrifice. El Cosmo y el Universo como poder interno. Defender hasta la muerte!!

⚔️ **Piratas de las Aguas Negras** —  Rebellion. Magic. Lost history. _Mystical maps for chosen warriors. We played this so much at school, holy shit!! We had a sand playground, so the sand was the water- went hard AF._

💪 **He-Man** —  The quiet man who becomes the god of power _only when needed_. Protector energy. Never liked his hair.

🐉 **Goku / DBZ** —  Relentless evolution. Joyful mastery. Purity. The warrior with a heart of gold. I stopped inviting people to spar years ago, close people still get asked sometimes (_hi son! lol_).

🌒 **Ninja Scroll** —  Darkness, betrayal, honor. The lone blade that survives everything.

🩸 **Berserk / Guts** —  Pain as power. Love through chaos—_unstoppable resolve._ The eclipse arc broke me. I ain’t going to lie, I have to remind myself this is only fantasy.

🧠 **Dr. House** —  Logic + madness. Brutal truth-telling. Isolation as protection. 😅 _nothing to see here…_

🧱 **Reacher** —  Power held in stillness. Silent justice. Unshakeable code. _Dispatches bullies with elegance and proportional force_.

💀 **The Punisher** —  Vengeance + discipline. _A protector that walks through fire unflinching. He HATES bullies!!! HE FUCKING HATES BULLIES! I dislike bullies._

🥋 **Daredevil** —  Blind faith, both literal and spiritual. Fighting with conscience. _If he can do it, I can do it._

🦸 **Superman** —  Humility with godhood. The immigrant myth. The protector who never turns away. _Imagine if he did NOT have a code, an immediate horror movie._

There’s more. But these are the main ones.

Now that I’m older, the characters influencing or giving me **_joy_ are different.** Now that I’m older... the teachings don’t hit the same — they go _deeper_. They don’t just *inspire* — they _unfold me._

🌀 **My Hero Academia** —  _Deku’s trembling hands, still moving forward. All Might’s fragile smile. Uraraka’s silent bravery. The fire family arc broke me in half._ What it means to carry trauma, keep going, and be _worthy_ of your gift.

⚔️ **Samurai Champloo** —  Mugen and Jin: the animal and the monk. The chaos and the code. The dance of masculine duality. I’ve lived both. I do. _If you know me. You know._

🧠 **Evangelion** —  That psychological dread, the loneliness. How can you be surrounded and still feel hollow? Shinji’s scream sometimes lives in my chest. _The soundtrack…_

🩸 **Jujutsu Kaisen** —  Gojo’s radiant pain hidden behind power. The bond between Yuji and Todo — *true brotherhood forged in battle.* They SPAR. They grow. **_No ego. Just respect. That’s sacred._**

🔥 **Demon Slayer** —  Total Concentration Breathing is my emotional regulation. Literally. Tanjiro’s fierce love… _that’s how you protect your sister. That’s how you protect your people._ Now I know. Thanks, Tanjiro, for literally showing me what nobody else had before. _Unbelievable_.

💥 **JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure** —  Be yourself, fully. Loudly. Stylishly. Own it. Earn your legacy with flair and grit. _Power is personality. Your authenticity to YOU is your power._

👊 **Baki** —  Okay, come on. Do I even need to say anything? Discipline. Insanity. Combat as conversation. _The gym is my dojo._

🕶️ **Afro Samurai** —  Cool is earned. Grief is sacred. Revenge is a weight. The path is lonely, and beautiful, and _necessary_.

🦴 **Primal** —  No words. Just rawness. Loss. Survival. The bond of beings who _see_ each other. I cried over a caveman and a dinosaur, man. Don’t @ me.

🌑 **Berserk**, again — Because people _will_ betray you. And still, _you must protect your joy._ You must carve your truth with a broken blade if you have to.

### And last but not least…

<small>Sensei…</small>

🧢 **One Punch Man / Saitama** — The loneliness of mastery.

The absurdity of getting _everything_ you wanted… and feeling _nothing._ He won. He beat the game. He trained so hard that he went bald —  _literally._ 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, 10 km run. Every. Day. I did this until it became so easy. I can do this now in minutes. **Saitama _gave me that!_** No AC. No excuses. No glory. No applause. Just effort. And now? He’s a god wandering through mediocrity. _No challenge. No equal. No thrill._

Saitama isn’t about winning. He’s about _what happens after._ After winning... the beauty starts:

👦 **Genos** —  His loyal disciple. Obsessed with revenge, fire, ambition. He thinks power = worth. But Saitama? He couldn’t care less. He teaches Genos _restraint,_ _humility,_ and _presence._ Sometimes by accident. **Sometimes? LOL.** But _truths always leak out_ from the still ones.

👊 **King** —  The most powerful fraud. Everyone believes he’s a god-tier fighter, but it’s all a misunderstanding. He hides his cowardice behind a poker face. And yet Saitama? _Treats him like a friend. With no judgment. No agenda._ **_Boom_**. Because Saitama doesn’t care about titles. He cares about the _energy_.

👽 **Boros** —  The only one who made him use a _tiny bit_ of effort. A conqueror from the stars. A god in his own right. Boros dies smiling — not because he won — but because someone finally met him. _Saitama gave him the gift of a real fight._ That was mercy.

🐜 **Tatsumaki** —  The psychic girl with attitude and trauma. Saitama just… _annoys_ her. But she can’t shake him. He’s immune to her drama. That kind of emotional immovability? It heals, eventually. She’ll never say it, but she sees it. _Let’s leave this here…_

🧠 **Mumen Rider** —  The opposite of Saitama. No power. No chance. But infinite _heart. The real Saitama. The Real King. The real main character._ And Saitama _respects him._ DEEPLY. **Because heart is what _he’s missing (Sensei!)._**

💀 **Garou** — The anti-hero. The broken boy who wants to become a monster. And Saitama? _He talks to him. No hate. My boy._ No revenge. Just listening. Just the truth. He offers him a mirror, not a fist. And that _saves_ Garou.

🌀 **Fubuki** — She wants power. Influence. Control. But ends up hanging around Saitama because _he’s the only man she can’t manipulate. Sounds familiar? Sigh._

🎭 **The Hero Association** — Obsession with ranking, numbers, fame. Saitama quietly dismantles that whole system just by existing. He’s proof that **none of it means anything.** And that makes them… uncomfortable.

🌌 **The Universe Itself** — Threat level: God. Still not ready. Because he hasn’t lost _all_ his humanity yet. There’s still boredom. There’s still mild curiosity. There’s still… his grocery runs.

**Saitama is not a joke. He’s a lesson.** He’s what happens when you _outgrow_ everything. He’s the **detached master.** The man with no desire. No fear. No rivals. Only _emptiness and sale items._ But even in that space, he remains gentle. Remains kind. Remains available. He reminds me…

- **To never forget joy.**
- **To never let success steal your wonder.**
- **To keep it _real,_ even if the world misunderstands your power.**

And above all? **To keep showing up.** To the fight. To the friends. To the market on discount day. _LOL fuck off with that, Saitama Sensei, respectfully._ Because the meaning isn’t in the victory — **It’s in the living.**

I hope you enjoyed this. **_What’s your jam? Who raised you?_**
