There was a time — _not long ago_ — when I thought I had to hold everything together by sheer will. My thoughts were tightly wound, my morals sharpened like swords, my identity built like a fortress. I wasn't living — _I was defending_. But from what?! I still don't know to this day. From my past trauma? Deep sigh.

I confused being unbreakable with being unbending. But everything that refuses to bend eventually cracks.

## El Día Que Me Rompí

I remember a morning not too far back, mid-divorce chaos, co-parenting tension, work pressures stacking, and my baby girl asking me something simple like, "Papi, can we play now?" And I said no — not because I couldn't, but because I was too wrapped up in being "responsible." And she looked at me like I had already drifted a million miles away.
That's when I heard it: _*snap*_. Not out loud. Inside. I realized I was following a script no one asked me to write. Protective logic. Identity anchoring. That exhausting need to always be right, good, disciplined.

That day, I sat outside with cafecito and stared at the sky. No podcast. No productivity. Just me. Breathing. I asked myself:

> What if I'm not failing — just evolving?
> What if I let myself feel instead of fix?

Since then, I've been practicing the art of flow. No more black-and-white thinking. No more rigid "shoulds." Just presence. Soft strength. Amor. I started letting love in. Not just romantic — _real love_:

- Letting my kids interrupt me with joy
- Laughing instead of snapping _(my snapping = serious face with a deep sigh)_
- Walking away from online fights I used to jump into
- Asking myself "¿Esto me da paz?" before engaging

I stopped asking "Is this right?" and started asking "Is this true for me?" Flexibility, I realized, isn't weakness. It's wisdom. Water doesn't fight rocks — it shapes them over time.

## Soft Heart, Strong Hands

I still have standards. I still lead. But I've burned the rulebook I wrote in survival mode. Now I will:

- Bend with the winds of change
- Sit in the messy middle
- Let things be complex
- Allow joy in small moments

Because I love love.
I love life.
And I love who I'm becoming when I choose flexibility over fear.

## A Reminder (pa' mí y pa' ti)

Be rooted like bamboo, pero sway when needed.
Be like tide — rise, fall, return.
Be like love — messy, real, and free.

Bend. Don't break.
