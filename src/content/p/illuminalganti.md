Someone DMed me on Bluesky claiming I was "chosen to join the Illuminati."

Thousands of followers on their profile. Vague mysticism. They asked for my name.

I replied:

> **I am the source.**

A few minutes later? The account disappeared.

## So… was it real?

Let's unpack the layers.

### 🕯️ The Real Illuminati

- Originated in 1776 Bavaria.
- A secret society promoting reason, not ritual.
- Disbanded by the 1780s.
- No hooded figures controlling Spotify playlists.

### 🧠 The Meme Version

- Celebrity puppets.
- World domination.
- Shadowy elites drinking baby blood?  
  This is fear-fueled fantasy mixed with real frustration about power.

### 🧍🏽‍♂️ What _was_ real?

A scam. Classic social engineering:

- Ego bait ("you were chosen")
- Data gathering ("what's your name?")
- Likely leading to spiritual manipulation or money requests.

But the script broke when I didn't play along.  
I answered like a man who doesn't follow pyramids — he breaks them.

## Final thought

> **Real power doesn't need robes. It builds quietly, protects fiercely, and serves something bigger than itself.**

And sometimes it just replies:  
**"I am the source."**
