## 🌄 From Hunger to Power: Fasting as a Metabolic Reset

I fasted from 5:30 AM to 4:00 PM today. Not for aesthetics. Not for a trend.  
I needed **clarity**. **Stillness**. **Dominion** over impulse.

> _"I'm not starving. I'm choosing."_

## 🧬 What Happens in the Body?

| Phase             | Timeframe | What Activates                                     |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fed State         | 0–4 hrs   | Blood glucose rises; insulin active                |
| Fasting State     | 4–12 hrs  | Glucagon ↑; glycogen breaks down, energy conserved |
| Autophagy Kick-in | 10+ hrs   | Old cells recycled, inflammation lowers            |

### Key Benefits

- Increased **human growth hormone** (HGH)
- Improved **insulin sensitivity**
- Onset of **autophagy**: cellular self-repair
- Reduced **mental fog** + tighter dopamine cycles

## 🧠 Values Practiced

- **Sovereignty**: Mastery over craving
- **Discipline**: Saying _no_ for a greater _yes_
- **Clarity**: Reclaiming mental space
- **Gratitude**: Earning your meal
- **Presence**: Each breath matters
