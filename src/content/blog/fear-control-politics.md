## "You are not fighting evil. You are losing to your own sickness."

That's the post that started this.

A sharp, cut-clean Threads drop born out of a single observation:

> Every single hardcore Republican I meet is obsessed with **gays**, **trans people**, **abortion**, **rape**, or **pedophilia**.

Like clockwork.

They're not talking about food systems.  
Not talking about infrastructure.  
Not talking about digital rights or parenting or the price of insulin.  
Just... sex. And punishment. And fear.

I sat back and said:
**"This isn't a political ideology. It's a trauma disorder with a flag."**

## The Obsession With Control: A Red Flag of Inner Chaos

Let's break it down with a cold, steel-blade table:

| Healthy People            | Unwell Ideologues                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create, heal, protect     | Punish, restrict, surveil                   |
| Ask real questions        | Project shame as moral law                  |
| Love complexity           | Obsess over binaries (good/evil, man/woman) |
| Trust the body and spirit | Distrust pleasure, embodiment, difference   |

You don't need a PhD in psychology to recognize this:

> When your identity requires control over strangers,  
> **you are no longer political. You are unwell.**

## The Real Diagnosis: Not Evil, But Afraid

> "Fear is the mind-killer."

Fear turns _curiosity_ into _conspiracy_.  
Fear turns _moral agency_ into _moral policing_.  
Fear says:

> _"If I control them, I won't have to face myself."_

(Chaos break: Do you think there's a secret lab of old white men somewhere injecting Fox News straight into their frontal lobes? Because I do. It's shaped like a bald eagle, it's underground in Utah, and it smells like microwave bacon.)

But back to the point:

Control addiction isn't about righteousness.  
It's about internal collapse masquerading as order.

## What Healing _Actually_ Looks Like

It's not a bill. It's not a protest sign. It's not shouting on the internet.

It's... kind of boring, honestly.

It looks like:

- Therapy.
- Accountability.
- Shutting the hell up and listening.
- Letting go of punishment fantasies.
- Realizing your "enemy" is a mirror.

That's why healing is so rare: it requires the one
