# Media Optimization Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive media optimization performed on the Strong Hands, Soft Heart blog. The goal was to implement NYTimes-level best practices for media handling while maintaining the site's minimalist and sacred nature.

## Components Created

### 1. Figure Component (`src/components/media/Figure.astro`)

- Responsive image handling with proper aspect ratios
- WebP format with quality optimization
- Lazy loading with eager loading option for above-the-fold
- Proper alt text and caption support
- Accessibility-first design
- Reduced motion support

### 2. Video Component (`src/components/media/Video.astro`)

- Semantic video element with proper attributes
- Aspect ratio locking
- Poster image support
- Accessibility features (title, controls)
- Fallback content for unsupported browsers
- Reduced motion support

### 3. Gallery Component (`src/components/media/Gallery.astro`)

- Responsive grid layout
- Configurable columns and gaps
- Reuses Figure component for consistency
- Mobile-first design
- Performance optimized
