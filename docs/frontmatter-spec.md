# Frontmatter Specification

This document defines the frontmatter format for all blog posts in the Blog.

## Reading Time System

**Automatic Calculation**: Reading times are now automatically calculated using an Astro remark plugin that analyzes the actual content length. This provides accurate, consistent reading time estimates across all posts.

**Legacy Cleanup**: All manual `readingTime` fields have been removed from existing content. Reading times are now exclusively calculated automatically.

**Field Priority**: The system uses `minutesRead` (automatic) for all reading time calculations.
