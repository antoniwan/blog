# Guided Path Implementation

## Overview

The Guided Path is a revolutionary reading experience that organizes blog content by seasons and years, providing users with a natural way to track their reading progress while maintaining complete privacy.

## Core Concept

Instead of endless scrolling through chronological feeds, the Guided Path organizes thoughts and ideas by the natural rhythm of seasons. Each chapter represents a season of a year, allowing users to say "I already read Fall 2023" or "I'm currently in Spring 2024."

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

```
src/
├── pages/
│   └── guided-path.astro          # Main Guided Path page
├── components/
│   └── Chapter.astro              # Enhanced chapter component
└── data/
    └── navigation.ts              # Updated navigation with Guided Path
```

### Seasonal Organization Logic

#### Season Detection

```typescript
function getSeason(date: Date): string {
    const month = date.getMonth();
    if (month >= 2 && month <= 4) return 'Spring';
    if (month >= 5 && month <= 7) return 'Summer';
    if (month >= 8 && month <= 10) return 'Fall';
    return 'Winter';
}
```

#### Season Date Ranges

```typescript
function getSeasonDates(year: number, season: string): { startDate: Date; endDate: Date } {
    switch (season) {
        case 'Spring':
            return {
                startDate: new Date(year, 2, 1), // March 1
                endDate: new Date(year, 5, 31)   // May 31
            };
        case 'Summer':
            return {
                startDate: new Date(year, 5, 1), // June 1
                endDate: new Date(year, 8, 31)   // August 31
            };
        case 'Fall':
            return {
                startDate: new Date(year, 8, 1), // September 1
                endDate: new Date(year, 11, 30)  // November 30
            };
        case 'Winter':
            return {
                startDate: new Date(year, 11, 1), // December 1
                endDate: new Date(year + 1, 2, 28) // February 28/29
            };
    }
}
```

### Chapter Generation

The system automatically generates seasonal chapters based on:

1. **Current Date**: Determines the current season and year
2. **Earliest Post**: Finds the earliest published post to establish the starting point
3. **Seasonal Progression**: Creates chapters from current season backwards to earliest post

```typescript
function generateSeasonalChapters(posts: typeof allPosts): SeasonalChapter[] {
    const chapters: SeasonalChapter[] = [];
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();
    const currentSeason = getSeason(currentDate);
    
    // Get the earliest post date to determine how far back to go
    const sortedPosts = posts.sort((a, b) => a.data.pubDate.valueOf() - b.data.pubDate.valueOf());
    const earliestPostDate = sortedPosts[0]?.data.pubDate || currentDate;
    const earliestYear = earliestPostDate.getFullYear();
    
    // Create chapters from current season backwards to earliest post
    const seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
    
    for (let year = currentYear; year >= earliestYear; year--) {
        // For current year, start from current season
        // For past years, include all seasons
        const startSeasonIndex = year === currentYear ? seasons.indexOf(currentSeason) : 0;
        
        for (let i = startSeasonIndex; i < seasons.length; i++) {
            const season = seasons[i];
            const { startDate, endDate } = getSeasonDates(year, season);
            
            // Skip future seasons
            if (startDate > currentDate) continue;
            
            // Skip seasons before earliest post
            if (endDate < earliestPostDate) continue;
            
            const chapterId = `${season.toLowerCase()}-${year}`;
            const chapterTitle = `${season} ${year}`;
            
            chapters.push({
                id: chapterId,
                title: chapterTitle,
                year,
                season,
                startDate,
                endDate,
                posts: []
            });
        }
    }
    
    return chapters;
}
```

## Privacy-First Progress Tracking

### Local Storage Implementation

All progress tracking is implemented using browser localStorage with complete privacy:

```typescript
// Progress tracking using localStorage
const readPosts = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('readPosts') || '[]');

// Mark post as read
function markPostAsRead(postId: string) {
    const readPosts = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('readPosts') || '[]');
    if (!readPosts.includes(postId)) {
        readPosts.push(postId);
        localStorage.setItem('readPosts', JSON.stringify(readPosts));
    }
}
```

### Privacy Features

- **Local Storage Only**: All data stored in user's browser
- **No Analytics**: Zero tracking or data collection
- **User Control**: Clear browser data to reset progress anytime
- **Transparent**: Clear privacy notice explaining data handling
